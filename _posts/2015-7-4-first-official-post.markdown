####Jekyll Powered

This is my first official post, and after a couple of days trying to setup the website. I originally planned to use wordpress for my website and host it on openshift, but i had problems on the theme I wanted. After some thinking, I've decided to just use jekyll, I have tested jekyll previously but I haven't done much customizations back then.

I'm glad to have found a great theme "freelancer", it is also available on bootstrap but I'm using the jekyll version. I personally like the one-page style of the theme, others may hate it but who cares.

The blog page on the other hand, i came across a blog theme from Twitter Bootstraps example.

Jekyll looks promising, No need for databases and complicated setup. And I think someone with great coding skills can do great with Jekyll.

On another note, I have completed the home page and the blog page, i may need to make minor tweaks but they are basically done. I am still missing the portfolio page, and maybe add commenting with disqus later on.

Oh and I may need a logo =s.

Well that is it for now.

2. jeromelachaud for the jekyll freelancer-theme found [here](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) .
3. [TA-portfolio Wordpress Theme](http://portfolio.themeart.co/) was the original theme I wanted, it was also based on the freelancer theme, but I just couldn't get some features to work with openshift. After some reading I found that it is mostly an issue the way openshift handles wordpress, and then I just gave up on it.
4. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
5. [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for the great icons used on the entire website.
