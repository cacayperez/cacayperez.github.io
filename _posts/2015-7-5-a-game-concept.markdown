####Lovely Moon Out There

Here is a preview of the Dark Castle which is shown on the main page.

I started of with a simple pixel art for a castle concept, but somehow as i worked through it, i slowly kept increasing the size and it came in between pixel art and vector art. I really
Enjoyed it and turned used it as my wallpaper.

I've shared this with some gaming friends of mine, and thought why not share this with people.

There are currently 2 versions, because when I had to use it for my computer i had a lot of trouble. The 1920x1080 version looked
crisp and great on photo viewer, but when I applied it as my wallpaper, there were some quality loss and some details were obviously pixelated.
Later I found out that windows automatically compresses wallpaper images to improve performance. And with the help of google I found the simple
solution of doubling the image size. And it worked great for me.
